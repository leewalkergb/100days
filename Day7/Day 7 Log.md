### Hacking the Fender Project

---

> **Scenario**
> 
> 
> `The Fender`, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access toÂ `The Fender`â€˜s systems, you must update hisÂ `"passwords.txt"`Â file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature ofÂ `Slash Null`, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted byÂ `The Fender`Â if they viewedÂ `Slash Null`Â as a threat.
> 
> Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.

```python
#Note the format of a dictionary is
new_dict = {
  'key1': 'val1',
  'key2': 'val2'
}
```

Task completed but a bit messy. Couldnâ€™t get the ascii art formatted properly.

```python
# Multiline strings use the
multi_string = '''This
is
a 
multiline
string
'''
```

Files project is now completed.

The python fundamentals for data science in the Data Scientist Analytics Career Path has more things to complete in comparison with the Analyze Data with Python skill path version.

Iâ€™ve decided to close out the outstanding exercises in the career path so everything is aligned.

### Lists

First up is an article that talks about the zip function again.

It points out that you can cast a zip object to a list the following way

```python
owners = ["Jenny", "Alexus", "Sam", "Grace"]
dogs_names = ["Elphonse", "Dr. Doggy DDS", "Carter", "Ralph"]

names_and_dogs_names = zip(owners, dogs_names)
# Cast to list
list_of_names_and_dogs_names = list(names_and_dogs_names)

print(list_of_names_and_dogs_names)
```

I then moved on to the lists project for medical insurance.

Decided to carry on tomorrow

## Useful Information

- N/A today

## Reflections

- Remember this is for fun not a second job. If Iâ€™ve had enough after an hour then thats OK there is always tomorrow.

## Tomorrowâ€™s Focus

- Close out the outstanding exercises in the Data Scientist Analytics career path so everything is aligned.
- One this is done I will move on to SQL to mix things up.
