# 100 Days of Code

**The rules are as follows:**

- The challenge will last for 100 days from the point I begin
- Ideally I will code for a minimum of one hour a day, but hopefully more
- Progress will be logged daily I intend to do this via entries in Notion using a proforma template.

**Other non-official rules:**

- I can use the time to focus on whatever I want however it must be something that works towards one of the objectives below
- There is no restriction on language but I should focus on Python, Git/Bash skills, MATLAB/Simulink and SQL as priorities

# Objectives

I will aim to achieve the following within the 100 days:

1. Become competent in the use of Git and use it to submit whatever work I do daily (or at least a ‘cheatsheet’ entry if I do activities on a platform, which could just be a markdown file export).
2. Create a github pages website by the end of the 100 days to include: Resume, Blog/featured projects mostly for fun.
    1. The preferred method is a static site that is based on markdown
3. Complete the analyse data with python skill path on codeacademy.
4. Learn the basics of SQL and use it in at least one bigger scale project.
5. Where possible I should look to automate.
6. Complete 5 bigger scale projects that utilise skills that have been learned.
    1. One of these should be fully documented for practice.
    2. One of these should have an implementation of a GUI
    3. One of these should be statistically based.
7. I should learn to be more effective with visualisation
